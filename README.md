# My dotfiles
...and an installation script for a fresh linux with yay, hyprland and waybar.

_I like rice, but i prefer pasta_    

> [!NOTE]
> This rice is heavily inspired (copied) from [SolDoesTech](https://github.com/soldoestech)'s hyprland repos, check those if you'd like a probably better tested config. It also uses config taken from [klpod0s](https://github.com/klpod221/klpod0s). If there are any issues with the [hyprland](https://wiki.hyprland.org/) and [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/) configuration, before opening an issue, check with the wikis as i have no idea what i'm doing, also don't trust random installation scripts online :). If there are issues with the installation scripts report it here ty. 

Clone the repository to copy and use these configuration files. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/00Darxk/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

I will make another branch, and move the italian version there. For now you'll need to make the changes yourself to change the language in these configs: [installupdates.sh](./waybar/scripts/installaupdates.sh),  [hyprland.conf](./hypr/hyprland.conf) under input select your keyboard layout, [waybar](/waybar/modules.jsonc) modules, [wlogout](./wlogout/layout), [rofi](./rofi/config.rasi), [starship.toml](./starship.toml). These changes are purely aesthetics. 

# Installation

## Automatic

Run the [install script](./install.sh), it will try to install all needed [dependencies](#dependencies) 
> [!CAUTION]
> This script DOES NOT backup any config files you may have, it is meant for a fresh install. Use it if you know what you are doing. 

```sh
install.sh
```
Yay need to be installed, as its used by the script to install all the packages. Refer to the official [yay page](https://github.com/Jguer/yay?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation.  

## Manual

Below a table of each package that should be installed, and its purpose. If you choose to install another package for the same purpose, you should also check the corresponding configuration files.

# Overview

## Hyprland

### Keybindings

You can check the keybinds in the [hyprland config](./hypr/hyprland.conf), or on the table below.

It contains explicit keybinds for F1 to F6 function keys, although they, and multimedia keys, should all work out of the box; if there are issues check your keyboard on the [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Extra_keyboard_keys), and bind them to the corresponding keys. 

<!-- | <kbd>FN1</kbd>                                 | Mute speaker |
| <kbd>FN2</kbd>                                 | Increase speaker volume |

> [!NOTE]
> I don't remember why I converted all the backgrounds from png to jpg, it should work either way. Too lazy to check the wiki. 

To add a new wallpaper to hyprland, add a line at the end of the [hyprland.conf](./hypr/hyprland.conf) file, specifying the location of the image. 
To set it at start, change the location of the exec call inside the [config](./hypr/hyprland.conf) to the background image. 

In the same way you can edit the top line of the [swaylock config](./swaylock/config) to change the background image. 

## Waybar 
<!-- TODO add module description, link to wiki -->
### Default Modules

### Hyprland Modules

### Wake on LAN and Tailscale Module
If you'd like to use the waybar module to wake a machine over LAN either follow the instructions in the installation scripts or create the ```./secrets``` folder, the ```ip-address.txt``` and ```mac-address.txt``` files.

The [wol.sh](./waybar/scripts/wol.sh) sends a magic packet to the machine, using the [wol](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wake-on-lan/) package. Change the script if you would like to use a different application. 

 the same module can be used to ssh into another machine using tailscale, for this create the ```hostname.txt``` file inside the secret folder with the hostname or the ip address in your tailscale network. For simplicity both these functions refer to the same machine. 
You can just comment out or remove the module in [waybar config](./waybar/config.jsonc) if you don't use it. If you haven't configured it, it will not show in waybar. 

To WoL left-click the module, to ssh right-click it; the color of the module shows the tailscale status of the machine you configured, not if the machine itself is on or off. If you have enabled tailscaled on the machine it will show the machine status, as it starts on startup. If you have set different machines for WoL and ssh the tooltip refers only to the ssh machine.

### GitHub Notifications Module

Instructions in the waybar [wiki](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Module:-Custom:-Simple#github-notifications). Place the ```notifications.token``` inside the ```.secrets``` folder. 

## Wlogout

This configuration is *almost* entirely taken from [klpod0s](https://github.com/klpod221/klpod0s), an aestethic, dynamic and minimal configuration for hyprland; just changed the color theme and tweaked a bit. 

## Rofi

This configuration is taken, and edited, from [adi1090's rofi collection](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi). 

## Themes

I tried to base it off this [color scheme](https://color.adobe.com/it/olor-Theme-color-theme-18068611/), but I'm not really good with that, if someone who knows colors could help I'd be very thankful :). 

I use [squared theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2206255) for gtk, and [ant-dark](https://store.kde.org/p/1640981/) icons theme. To add themes and icon themes download and unzip theme respectively in ```~/.themes``` and ```~/.local/share/icons```, use this last directory to store cursor icons (i use my oshi [Rin Penrose](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2260618)'s)

For `sddm` I use the [eucalyptus-drop](https://gitlab.com/Matt.Jolly/sddm-eucalyptus-drop) theme, it is available on the AUR, and installed through the [install script](./install.sh).
